## Using StockSearch Application

This is a small project that can be used to look up information about certain stocks.

It is simple to use: It has four preset buttons that are links to real stocks.

In order to get information about a certain stock, the user simply inputs the data, e.g. "A" or "AAPL" in the input field provided or clicks on one of the existing buttons.

The user need not worry about letter case. Everything is automatically made uppercase.

When the "stock" button is pressed, the related information is displayed below.

The application is useful in getting quick information about stocks one is intrested in.
